CSC 275 - Advanced C++

Unfortunately I have only one program left from this course, it's adding and removing parts from an order using C++ and flat files. In the early 2000s the University of Michigan - Flint heavily taught C++ and we often used Borland's C++ compiler. The cool kids used MS Visual C++, I used Borland as I didn't feel like turning my program in on a CD-r or Zip Drive, gotta love Microsoft bloat.
